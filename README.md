# Indie Think Tank!

____Have a awesome game idea? Post it here!
Are you a game developer looking for something to do? Check out our Ideas, and share with the community!
Its that simple.____

A common practice for developers to do Game a month projects. One month to make a completed project. This homes their skill, and gives them oppurtunity to experement outside what they are used to making, without loosing much time.
I remember having many dreams of game ideas, characters, plots but no ability to create them. Wishing I knew someone who could. Now you can!
Just submit your idea and a dev working on a game a month project may like to work on that. And will upload the result here.
